We attemp to create a cache eviction policy using multi-label multi-class supervised learning and reinforcement learning. For reinforcement learning context, we treat the problem as a multi-armed bandit problem, with action space equals to the cache size.  

## Supervised Learning Approach

## Reinforcement Learning Approach
- REINFORCE: Achieve near optimal  
- Actor Critic: Fails to achieve near optimal
